Description about the project:
"People who are visually impaired deal with several different obstacles on a daily basis.
We present the "comprehensive blind app," a fusion of cutting-edge technologies including object detection, OCR, voice controls, and navigation, to address these issues. 
Independence, accessibility, and empowerment are all goals of this app. The architecture, development methodology, user-centric features, and findings from usability testing and effect analysis
are all covered in the paper. The study highlights how the app can improve visually impaired users' lives by encouraging inclusivity and empowerment in the digital era.
